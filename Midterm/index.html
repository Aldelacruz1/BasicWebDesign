        <h3>WCC Crew #956 The Trail Angels</h3>
        <h1>YCC Women's Conservation Crew, In-Town Crew</h1>
        <p>The YCC Women’s Conservation Crew is designed to provide an opportunity for young women (16-18) in the Chattanooga area to explore conservation and natural resources work on our local public lands. The intent behind this single identity crew is to create a supportive environment, foster empowerment, and increase career opportunities for the members while providing the space for them to engage with mentors and co-workers who share their identity. This specific crew seeks to increase career opportunities to females who think they might be interested in conservation. Applicants do not need to have prior experience to apply for this position as it is a training and development program. This crew will work with Chickamauga & Chattanooga NMP.</p>

        <h2>The Future of Conservation and Service</h2>
        <p>SECC’s service projects for Youth Conservation Crew programs take place throughout the state of Tennessee and neighboring states within the Southeast region. For a majority of these projects, Corpsmembers will work, live and camp communally in teams consisting of six crewmembers and two leaders. Projects include, but are not limited to, trail design, maintenance and construction, watershed restoration, habitat enhancement, fencing, tree planting, invasive plant removal, and much, much more. Along with earning a living allowance, all Corpsmembers learn invaluable professional and personal skills. Corpsmembers that complete an SECC service program re-enter their communities as individuals with elevated employment skills and stronger presence of leadership, resiliency, and dedication to natural resources.</p>
