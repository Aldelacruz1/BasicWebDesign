        <h1>Youth Conservation Crew Programs</h1>
        <p>During the summer months, SECC operates the Youth Conservation Corps programs. The crews are for high school aged youth, run for six weeks and are paid service positions.</p>
        
        <p>These programs provide job skills and leadership opportunities, as well as professional and personal development. A typical workday could include trail construction, trail maintenance, corridor clearing, invasive species removal, restoration of cultural resources, preservation of commemorative resources or habitat restoration. Members have the opportunity to work on local public lands, such as National Forests and National Parks.</p>

        <p>A typical SECC youth crew is comprised of two crew leaders and six corpsmembers, ages 16â€“18. Both in-town and camping crews are based out of the SECC office in Chattanooga, TN. Camping crews work within a 2-3 hours radius of Chattanooga, while in-town youth crews work within the greater Chattanooga area.</p>

        <p>Monday through Thursday, the crews complete meaningful service projects, such as trail maintenance and the removal of invasive species. When not working, the crew participates in daily education ranging from topics such as watersheds and forest ecology to resume building and interview tactics. On Fridays, the crew focuses on educational outings, which in the past, have included first aid and CPR certification, snorkeling on the Conasauga River, bird identification and more.</p>

        <p>The main distinction between the camping and local in-town crews is that Camping crews spend the entire week camping together at the worksite (Monday through Friday), while in-town crews return to the Chattanooga office at the end of each workday and spend the night at home. Camping crews will participate in daily communal living chores, eat meals together, and be engaged in daily education at the campsite.</p>
