            <h2>What Is Lunar New Year?</h2>
            <p>Lunar New Year is often referred to as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival. It is called the Lunar New Year because it marks the first new moon of the Lunaisolar Calendars which are traditional to many East Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Vietnam. Lunar New Year typically occurs between January 21 and February 20. This year it takes place on February 12 and it is the Year of the Ox. In mainland China, almost everybody refers to the new year as Spring Festival. But if you're in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or anywhere else in most of the Chinese diaspora, they're still calling it new year.</p><br>
            
            
            <h3>What You May See at Celebrations</h3>

            <p>Upside-down fu characters:</p>
            
            <p>On Chinese New Year, you'll commonly see a calligraphy character on a square of red paper, hung in a diamond shape. The character, 福 [fú], which means good luck, is hung upside down for Lunar New Year. "The word 'to arrive,' or to begin, is a homophone for the word for upside down," Maasbach explains. Through this bit of pictorial wordplay, the symbol effectively means that good luck is arriving, or pouring down on you.</p><br>

            <p>Red pockets full of money:</p>
            
            <p>Known as lì xì in Vietnamese or hóngbāo in Mandarin, in China they're traditionally gifted from an elder or parent to children, or really anyone who's unmarried. "It's really fun, because even if your brother is 40 and he's unmarried he still gets red envelopes," Maasbach says. The custom arose out of a tradition of using coins as a gift to ward off evil spirits.It's an occasion for kids to have a little fun when asking for an envelope, too. When asking, you have to say things like "xin nian kuai le", or "Happy New Year," or "gong xǐ fā cái", which means "make money in the new year". You'll say, "gong xǐ fā cái, hóngbāo ná lái!" This translates to, "Make a lot of money in the new year—now give me my red envelope!"</p><br>

            <h2>Year of The Ox</h2>

            <h3>What the Year of the Metal Ox Means for Each Chinese Zodiac Sign</h3>
                <h4>Rat</h4>
                <p>You can look forward to a more serene year and less of the chaos, Rat!
                
                You’ve undoubtedly experienced a lot of change and dramatic upheaval, but it’s time to breathe a sigh of relief. The Year of the Metal Ox brings back greater control of your surroundings.
                
                In love, you’re likely to meet someone who shares common interests and values, and if in an existing relationship, you’ll be keen to build on your material world to make things comfortable for you both.</p>
                
                Ox
                This is a year of prosperity for you, and you can look forward to positive outcomes in a variety of areas.
                
                Financially, this bodes well for you. Of all the signs, you are the one with the most dogged determination and this Ox year is particularly beneficial for you, especially if you yourself are a Metal Ox.
                
                In love, tradition and going through your family history can yield some surprising and interesting results.
                
                Tiger
                This may prove to be a challenging year for you, Tiger.
                
                You and the Ox battle it out at the best of times, but during the Year of the Metal Ox, your resolve will be tested more than once. You’ll have to summon your strength and courage, but you needn’t worry too much – courage is what you are known for.
                
                In love, there may be stormy moments but the potential for lasting bonds is there.
                
                Rabbit
                It’s a relatively decent year for you, Rabbit. It’s important you focus and ground yourself this year.
                
                There are a number of opportunities coming your way, but you’ll need to see them for what they are and not doubt yourself. The only thing standing in your way is self-doubt.
                
                In love, there is no need to rush into things. Let potential suitors come to you.

                Dragon
                A challenging year will ensue if you allow your ego to run amok, Dragon.
                
                Ox years are not the easiest for Dragons – both are strong characters, and the Ox does not submit so easily to the Dragon’s authority as other signs do. This is a year to move carefully and slowly, analyzing everything. Doing so can yield positive results.
                
                In love, be careful of ego battles or jealousy issues which can compromise an otherwise loving relationship.
                
                Snake
                This can be a spectacular year for you in terms of productivity, Snake, but it’s important to stay grounded and not get carried away with fly-by ideas.
                
                Keep your feet firmly on the ground and keep your eyes fixed on the long-term. In love, be careful of being – or coming across as – too possessive as this could break a relationship, or ruin a potential one.
                
                Horse
                It’s best to focus on work and your ambitions this year, Horse.
                
                You may need to do some special work in terms of moving on from the past. Zooming in on romantic relationships is not the best idea – this year should be all about you and your ambitions. Talents that have lain forgotten will see an upsurge.
                
                In love, issues from the past could creep up that can ruin existing and potential relationships. The Year of the Metal Ox is about focusing on you, Horse, and not filling an emotional void with another.
                
                
                 
                Goat
                Be economical, wise, and careful this year, Goat.
                
                The Ox stands against you in the Circle of Conflict and it can be a challenging year if you’re not on the ball. On the other hand, just like any other sign, you have the opportunity to harness the Ox’s hardworking and determined energy.
                
                Pay special attention to your creative talents because they could yield fruitful results. In love, it’s time to reset yourself and find balance where it is necessary. If a relationship is toxic, it is time to walk away.
                
                Monkey
                This can be a hectic year for you, Monkey, so this is no time for slacking.
                
                The Metal Ox year may present a number of challenges for you and it’ll be up and down most of the time. This is when you need to harness your famous Monkey ingenuity – be original, be quick, and think on your feet.
                
                Finances look good in 2021, but this needs to be tempered with clever thinking from you. Don’t say things you will regret. In love, you and your partner will be especially focused on finances, so teamwork is crucial; if single, you have the opportunity to forge a lasting relationship with another.
                
                Rooster
                This is a good year for you, and you are able to recover and prosper, especially in the material sense, Rooster.
                
                You have your wits about you and you are ready to embark on new ventures. It’s time to be clear about your ambitions and stick to the plan you lay out. Don’t let distractions get in your way.
                
                In love, be expressive and bold with your affections. You have the potential to attract several potential suitors with your new-found confidence. In an existing relationship, new ventures and romantic ideas can bring you closer together.
                
                Dog
                Self-discipline is a key theme of the year for you, Dog. Your success or lack of it will depend on it.
                
                You have the ability to turn something small into something spectacular, but distractions or lack of self-esteem could hinder you. Remember to have confidence in yourself. In love, try not to be critical of your partner if you are in an existing relationship.
                
                If single, do not spend too much time seeking someone – they will come to you when the time is right.
                
                Pig
                This is a positive year for you, Pig. Excellent professional prospects are on the way.
                
                You may have several offers open to you and this will take up most of your time and energy. Your intuition will help you make key decisions so make sure you listen to it. In love, things may not go as smoothly. You may feel frustrated with your partner or, if single, frustrated at the lack of action.
                
                Trust in the universe and believe that everything will happen at the right moment.
                
                Get Ready for the Year of the Metal Ox
                The Year of the Metal Ox 2021 promises greater stability and grounding, but the challenges are not over just yet.
                
                We must still have our wits about us, but thankfully we can see things clearer now. Working towards long-term goals and believing in our capabilities are key to finding success this Ox year, no matter what area of our life we are focusing on.
                
                Follow the advice for your sign and prepare yourself for the incoming Ox. Remember, the Ox values hard work and dedication, and will reward those who acquire these attributes during his year.</p>
