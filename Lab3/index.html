            <h2>What Is Lunar New Year?</h2>
            <p>Lunar New Year is often referred to as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival. It is called the Lunar New Year because it marks the first new moon of the Lunaisolar Calendars which are traditional to many East Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Vietnam. Lunar New Year typically occurs between January 21 and February 20. This year it takes place on February 12 and it is the Year of the Ox. In mainland China, almost everybody refers to the new year as Spring Festival. But if you're in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or anywhere else in most of the Chinese diaspora, they're still calling it new year.</p><br>
            
            
            <h3>What You May See at Celebrations</h3>

            <p>Upside-down fu characters:</p>
            
            <p>On Chinese New Year, you'll commonly see a calligraphy character on a square of red paper, hung in a diamond shape. The character, 福 [fú], which means good luck, is hung upside down for Lunar New Year. "The word 'to arrive,' or to begin, is a homophone for the word for upside down," Maasbach explains. Through this bit of pictorial wordplay, the symbol effectively means that good luck is arriving, or pouring down on you.</p><br>

            <p>Red pockets full of money:</p>
            
            <p>Known as lì xì in Vietnamese or hóngbāo in Mandarin, in China they're traditionally gifted from an elder or parent to children, or really anyone who's unmarried. "It's really fun, because even if your brother is 40 and he's unmarried he still gets red envelopes," Maasbach says. The custom arose out of a tradition of using coins as a gift to ward off evil spirits.It's an occasion for kids to have a little fun when asking for an envelope, too. When asking, you have to say things like "xin nian kuai le", or "Happy New Year," or "gong xǐ fā cái", which means "make money in the new year". You'll say, "gong xǐ fā cái, hóngbāo ná lái!" This translates to, "Make a lot of money in the new year—now give me my red envelope!"</p><br>
            
            
            <h4>Some Superstitions</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Eating porridge for breakfast is a no-no:

                    Porridge is considered to be a "poor man's breakfast," and people who follow Chinese New Year traditions don't want to start the year "poor."</li>
                    
                <li>Married daughters are discouraged from visiting their parents' homes:
                    
                    Chinese superstition believes that a married daughter who visits her parents on Lunar New Year will bring bad luck and economic hardship to the family. Traditionally, a married daughter will only be allowed to visit her parents on the second day of the Chinese New Year.</li>
                <li>Don't visit hospitals and avoid taking medicine:

                    It is believed that visiting hospitals during Chinese New Year will make a person sick for the rest of the year, and taking medicine on the first day of the lunar year will leave one ill for the rest of it.</li>
                <li>Keep children from crying:

                    The sound of a child's cry will bring bad luck to the family, according to the superstition, so make sure the kids are extra happy during Chinese New Year.</li>
                <li> Avoid borrowing or lending money:
                    
                    Tradition urges those who have debts to settle all their affairs by Lunar New Year as it is considered bad luck to enter another year with debts. Likewise, lending money is also discouraged during this time. </li>

                <li> No killing:

                    Avoid killing chickens, ducks, pigs or any other animal during the 15-day celebration of the Lunar New Year as blood is seen as a bad omen. Blood is believed to bring misfortune to those who kill during these days. Best to be wary and plan ahead.</li>

                <li>Refrain from wearing white or black clothes:

                    Black or white clothes are considered colors for mourning so tradition encourages wearing bright, happy colors.</li>
               
                <li>Take extra care of things in the house:

                    Breaking tools or any equipment during the Chinese New Year is regarded as an omen that one will lose their wealth all year-round, which is why many people go to extraordinary lengths to make sure nothing ends up getting broken in their household.</li>
