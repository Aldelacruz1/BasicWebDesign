            <h2>What Is Lunar New Year?</h2>
            <p>Lunar New Year is often referred to as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival. It is called the Lunar New Year because it marks the first new moon of the Lunaisolar Calendars which are traditional to many East Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Vietnam. Lunar New Year typically occurs between January 21 and February 20. This year it takes place on February 12 and it is the Year of the Ox. In mainland China, almost everybody refers to the new year as Spring Festival. But if you're in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or anywhere else in most of the Chinese diaspora, they're still calling it new year.</p><br>
            
            
            <h3>What You May See at Celebrations</h3>

            <p>Upside-down fu characters:</p>
            
            <p>On Chinese New Year, you'll commonly see a calligraphy character on a square of red paper, hung in a diamond shape. The character, 福 [fú], which means good luck, is hung upside down for Lunar New Year. "The word 'to arrive,' or to begin, is a homophone for the word for upside down," Maasbach explains. Through this bit of pictorial wordplay, the symbol effectively means that good luck is arriving, or pouring down on you.</p><br>

            <p>Red pockets full of money:</p>
            
            <p>Known as lì xì in Vietnamese or hóngbāo in Mandarin, in China they're traditionally gifted from an elder or parent to children, or really anyone who's unmarried. "It's really fun, because even if your brother is 40 and he's unmarried he still gets red envelopes," Maasbach says. The custom arose out of a tradition of using coins as a gift to ward off evil spirits.It's an occasion for kids to have a little fun when asking for an envelope, too. When asking, you have to say things like "xin nian kuai le", or "Happy New Year," or "gong xǐ fā cái", which means "make money in the new year". You'll say, "gong xǐ fā cái, hóngbāo ná lái!" This translates to, "Make a lot of money in the new year—now give me my red envelope!"</p><br>
